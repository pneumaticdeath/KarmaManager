# KarmaManager Privacy Policy

## What data we collect
### None
We do not collect any personal data, or even any aggregate data.  We do not automatically report install, usage
or crash statistics.  We really don't want to know.

## What we do with that data
### Nothing
Since we don't collect any data, we don't have any way of using that data.

## How do I tell you to get rid of my data with respect to GDPR or CCPA or similar
### Write to us
You can [email us](mailto:mitch@mitchpatenaude.net?Subject=KarmaManager%20Privacy%20Policy) if you like, but
like we've said, there isn't any data to get rid of.

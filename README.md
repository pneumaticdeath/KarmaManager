# **Karma Manager** is an **Anagram Maker**

This is an app version of the anagram maker web-site I built
called [Kamra-Manager.com](https://karma-manager.com/#!?input=Fyne.IO%20GUI%20toolkit&maindict=full-dict.json&addeddicts=names.json,places.json&pagesize=20),
written in Go using the [Fyne.io](https://fyne.io/) framework.

It can be built for desktop environments, but is primarily intended as a mobile app.

The name is an homage to an 80's shareware program for the Mac.  It's still accesible at
the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/MacintoshSharewareGamesK), though you'll
need an old mac to run it.
